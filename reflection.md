I started with home page including my name, and a little bit about myself. Then I did a page "About Me " where I included a little bit more information using images of myself and activities that I like. At the end I added "Contact me" page. I did not have a lot of technical difficulties, the hardest part for me was how to organize the website and to decorate it to fullfile all of the requieremnts but at the same time to look pretty.
